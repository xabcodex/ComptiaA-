# Safety Procedures

Your own personal safety is really important here:
* Personal safety: 
  * Trip hazards. Power or network cable on the floor.
  * Proper lifting techniques. Be careful lifting things that are heavy.
  * Component safety. For not damaging things. Electrostatic discharge is the most common hazard.
